## Headband manufacturing policy
The dimensions of the headband removed here are as follows.

Based on this, modify it as shown below so it can be sewn onto the headband.

The upper fabric of the headband has been split into two sections, with the seam allowance for each changed from 3mm to 5mm.
While hand sewing might be manageable, it's difficult for an amateur to sew straight with a 3mm seam allowance.
With a 5mm seam allowance, it should still take shape even if it's a bit crooked.

For the U-shaped stitch, it'd probably be easier to understand if you check out other videos instead of mine.

These ear pads aren't officially advertised for the MDR-1RBT, but they'll work just fine—they'll attach to the MDR-1RBT too.
There are plenty of other cheap ear pads out there, but their durability is questionable.
After that, it's up to you: either replace cheap ear pads frequently or use expensive ones for a long time.
Check out my video for how to install the ear pads.
Alright then.
See ya.
