# **Welcome to JUKE UNOTSUKI's site!**
This is a site providing supplementary information for JUKE UNOTSUKI's YouTube channel.

## **First, let me introduce myself.**
I'm JUKE UNOTSUKI, who a wreck of my former self of being human.
And this is the bottom of the pit, where I make and fix all sorts of things.

## **Why do we need this site?**
Ideally, everything would be wrapped up within the videos alone...
But the stuff I work on isn't just machines.
I want to create all kinds of things—machines, electrical circuits, programming, and more.
But videos have their limitations, especially when it comes to showing things like programming code.
It's just a bunch of text, after all.

That's where this site comes in.
If you watch the videos and get interested, I'd be thrilled if you checked out this site for reference.
